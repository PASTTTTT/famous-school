        <h1>This HTML page was created as part of an assignment for Mr. Onat Mufasa. The goal of the project was to practice basic web development skills by creating a simple webpage using HTML. Through this task, I learned how to structure a webpage using elements like headings, paragraphs, and links, while also understanding the importance of clean and organized code. This page reflects what Iâ€™ve learned so far and serves as a demonstration of my progress.</h1>
